## Abstract
This document outlines a research proposal to investigate the cross-sectional properties of the well-documented intraday–overnight return phenomenon. We leverage a long-history dataset of daily open, high, low, and close (OHLC) prices to construct a new pricing factor based on a stock’s historical intraday–overnight return differential.

The central hypothesis is that this factor’s premium is driven by modern market frictions, particularly those related to retail investor order flow and institutional trading constraints. This research aims to introduce a new, economically motivated pricing factor and provide evidence that its performance is linked to limits to arbitrage.

## Overview
This proposal explores whether the intraday–overnight return differential contains predictive information about future cross-sectional returns and whether it can be formalized as a new risk factor or behavioral factor.

Key directions include:
- Constructing a return-based factor using the intraday vs. overnight return spread.
- Testing cross-sectional pricing power using portfolio sorts and Fama–MacBeth regressions.
- Investigating microstructure channels such as order imbalance, liquidity frictions, and retail-driven noise trading.
- Evaluating robustness across size, liquidity, and volatility groups.
